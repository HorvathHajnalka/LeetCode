Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

strs = [ ‘abc’, ‘bca’, ‘cba’, ‘abcd’]
return = [ [‘abc’, ‘bca’, ‘cba’.], [‘abcd’]]

def anagrams(strs):
	anagram_dict = dict()
	for word in strs:
		sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))
		if sorted_word in anagram_dict:
			anagram_dict[sorted_word].append(word)
		else:
			anagram_dict[sorted_word] = [word]
	
	result = [ ]
	for words in anagram_dict.values():
		result.append(words)
	
	return result

strs = [ ‘abc’, ‘bca’, ‘cba’, ‘abcd’]
anagram_dict = {
	‘abc’ =[ ‘abc’, ‘bca’,’cba’ ] ,
	‘abcd’ = [abcd’]
}
sorted_word = ‘abcd’
result = [ [ ‘abc’, ‘bca’,’cba’ ] , [abcd’] ]
