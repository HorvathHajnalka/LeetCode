Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.

Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

k = 0? x
‘’ ? x
[] ? x
lower/upper ? x
invalid inputs? x

words = [‘abc’, ‘bca’, ‘abc’, ‘bca’, ‘a’] k = 2
return= [‘abc’, ‘bca’]

def topKFrequentWords(words, k):

	frequency_dict = dict()
	for word in words:
		if word in frequency_dict:
			 frequency_dict[word] += 1
		else:
			frequency_dict[word] = 1

	frequency_array = []
	for i in range(0, len(words)):
		frequency_array.append([])
	
	for word in frequency_dict:
		frequency_array[frequency_dict[word]].append(word)
	
	result = []
	for words in frequency_array.reverse():
		for word in words.sort():
			result.append(word)
			if len(result) == k:
				return result

frequency_dict = {
	‘abc’ = 2,
	‘bca’ = 2
	‘a’ = 1
}
frequency_array = [ [ ] , [‘a’ ] , [‘abc’ , ‘bca’] , [ ] , [ ] ]
result = [ ‘abc’ , ‘bca’ ]  <-
